# IBM-Data-Analyst-Capstone-Project
In this project, our role will be that of a Data Analyst working for a renowned global IT and business consulting services firm. This firm is well-known for its expertise in IT solutions and its team of highly experienced IT consultants. To stay ahead in the ever-changing technological landscape and maintain a competitive edge, our organization regularly examines data to anticipate future skill requirements.

As a Data Analyst, our primary responsibility is to support this initiative by gathering data from diverse sources and uncovering emerging skill trends for this year's report.

Our first task is to collect the top programming skills that are most in demand from various sources including: Job postings / Training portals / Surveys

Once we have collected a sufficient amount of data, we will commence the analysis phase, aiming to extract valuable insights and identify prevailing patterns.

To facilitate comprehension of the data analysis process, each step is documented in separate notebooks within this repository, accompanied by additional files for reference.
